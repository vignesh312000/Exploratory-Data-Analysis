        "My EDA is on a dataset containing information about hotel bookings. This analysis aimed to gain insights into booking trends, cancellation patterns, and various factors that influence hotel reservations.I started by examining the dataset, which included 35 columns (after data wrangling) providing information on booking details, customer demographics, and hotel-related factors.\n",
        "The dataset encompassed diverse features, such as booking date, guest demographics, room types, and booking status (canceled or not canceled).To understand booking trends over time, I plotted the number of bookings by year and month. This allowed me to identify peak booking periods and seasonal variations.\n",
        "Additionally, I examined the distribution of bookings across different days of the week.A significant part of my analysis focused on cancellations. I calculated the cancellation rate and explored how it varied based on different factors.\n",
        "Using bar plots , I visualized the distribution of canceled and non-canceled bookings.\n",
        "Using Box plot,I also investigated how lead time, booking changes, and other factors correlated with booking cancellations.Customer segmentation played a crucial role in the analysis. I explored how customer type, meal preferences, and other categorical features influenced booking behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grouped bar plots and other visualizations helped identify patterns among different customer segments.\n",
        "My analysis extended to operational aspects, such as the number of days in the waiting list. These insights can assist in optimizing hotel operations.Finally, I explored the dataset's potential for predictive modeling. I identified features that might be valuable for predicting booking cancellations or other business-related outcomes."

        "In conclusion, my exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hotel bookings revealed vital insights into booking patterns and customer behaviors. By carefully examining a dataset containing 35 columns of booking information, I uncovered significant trends and factors that influence hotel reservations. This analysis illuminated the busiest booking periods and highlighted specific days of the week when reservations are most common. Moreover, a close examination of booking cancellations, customer types, meal preferences, and operational aspects provided valuable knowledge that can inform strategic decision-making. Additionally, the potential for predictive modeling within the dataset hints at exciting opportunities for the future. Overall, the outcomes of this EDA offer actionable insights that can guide pricing strategies, marketing efforts, and enhancements to customer satisfaction, ultimately contributing to the hotel's success and operational efficiency.\n",

        "(2) Mostly guests stay for less than 5 days in hotel and for longer stays Resort hotel is preferred.\n",

        "(4) Most of the guests came from european countries, with most of guests coming from Portugal.\n",
